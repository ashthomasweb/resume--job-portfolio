      <p>This project is for a local business-woman sole-proprietor. Her business model has been restricted to
        Instagram, limiting her ability to provide her clientele and community with all that she has to offer. This
        website allows her to showcase her client's good behavior and have a blog where she can generate affiliate
        links and provide additional learning and enrichment opportunities to her clients.</p>
      <p>I used Node.js, express, and EJS to create the backend of the site. I connected a headless-CMS and built a blog
        main page and post template that autopopulates from the CMS. I connected the client's primary business traffic
        through a social media aggregator API enabling link-through SEO and audience ease-of-access.</p>

      <p>A "Simon Game" was one of the projects in the course I took. I decided to not follow the directions and simply
        complete the assignment knowing the basic function of a simon game. I incorporated pop-culture sounds and some
        distractions to make it difficult. The player can double-click on various background elements and make them
        slowly change color. Another single-click on that same element will stop the color change.</p>
      <p>This was my first solo project. I used jQuery for DOM manipulation, JS for control flow, and css for animations
        and transitions. The site is built using CSS Grid to ease in scaling to increased number of squares, or to aide
        in mobile development. Good luck, don't take Arnold too seriously.</p>

        <p class="experience-right">I have a keen eye for the flow of the page. I learned layout and design principles
          using Quark and an offset printing press. Clearly delivering information is the key to effective

          as many directions as it takes to get it perfect. Coding seems like a natural extension.</p>

          and designing code feels much the same, with the added bonus of showing your work to the world!</p>

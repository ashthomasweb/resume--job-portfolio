        <p>This project was built for a Colorado-based local business. The business' main advertising medium is face to face contact and referrals,
          which needed to be backed up with a website easily served up on a customer's phone. The client requested that all materials be presented on a single page. Delivering all the information and
          functionality one page
          proved to be a challenge more than I expected, and the project quickly grew out of my initially staged plans for development.
        </p>
        <p>The site runs on a node and express server. The site is a single page presentation. It is a landing page, about page, product page and order form at once. It uses a
          simple
          parallax on desktop and image background to provide a solid color at the top for legibility and cleanliness, and a Colorado-esque scene at the bottom for customer familiarity and business
          branding. </p>

        <p>This project is the conclusion to a hypothesis I had while a music teacher. At that time I did not know anything about programming other than it must follow standard logic principles. In
          short, I theorized that if you put all the 'rules' of music theory into code and allowed for randomization in it's choices, the resultant music would be surprisingly familiar and even sound
          pretty good at times- with only occasional awkward moments. This project is two-fold, containing a set of practice tools, as well as a music generator. The tools help a student train their
          ear in the subjects of melody, relative pitch, pitch memory, and tempo. The music generator is a passion project that I will continue to build upon for some time. In time it will not only
          be an expression of the power of western musical structures, but also a learning device.
        </p>
        <p>Work your klangfarbenmelodie chops with multiple orchestral instrument choices. The music trainer includes a function which allows for different instruments to randomly substitute the
          primary instrument sound, while still asking the student to repeat the pattern back. For instance, if you play piano, you can select french horn sounds to work with instead. This develops
          the ear to be sensitive to pitch while listening to instruments outside of their familiarity. The melodic idea consisting of the same note, but different tones/instruments, is called
          "klangfarbenmelodie". This type of exercise was extremely beneficial to my own ear during my development, and I had a difficult time finding ways to practice this type of hearing. This aural
          skill proved to be one of the most powerful connection points in the development of my musical ear. This melody trainer facilitates the study of an invaluable skill that is difficult to
          methodically practice.

        <p>"LumberJack" is a full-stack template developed for small businesses and social media creators. The theme is
          lightweight and integrates third-party services to eliminate update, security, and code-heavy issues.
          Featuring a headless CMS with Prismic, a multi-network aggregator in Curator, and automatic email responses by
          NodeMailer, LumberJack's needs for maintenance and updates are low. Ships with detailed setup instructions
          accessible by any front-end developer or diligent person.
        </p>
        <p>Making use of third-party API's keeps the website owner from having to engage with the site code after
          launch, keeping breakage to a minimum. LumberJack's blog is automatically generated using EJS and comes with
          a "Custom Type" ready to upload to your Prismic repository. Curator allows owners and creators to build feeds
          from more than one network, enabling more cross-network audience engagement.
        </p>
        <p>Designed for a two-color brand scheme with highly legible greyscale copy. Card elements are modular and can
          be used in a variety of configurations, color and size. LumberJack is fully compatible with any device.

        <p>This project was built for a local business-woman sole-proprietor. Her business model has been restricted to
          Instagram, limiting her ability to provide her clientele and community access to her services. The
          LumberJack template allows her to showcase her expertise and have a blog generating affiliate links and
          providing additional learning and enrichment opportunities to her clients. I worked with the owner, matching
          her business mission statement with a brand sense that appeals to her audience.
        </p>
        <p>Showcasing the client's primary business traffic encourages link-through SEO and grants audience
          ease-of-access to other materials and monetizable content. Mobile-friendly content creation allows the business
          owner to produce content more efficiently.</p>

            Flow Post is a skewmorphic organization application. Users can save
            custom boards and layouts. Board and note colors can be set by user
            and individual notes can be checked off. A special 'Mat' function
            creates a box that always remains behind the notes, serving as a
            visual container. Future versions will include a 'Share' function,
            multi-select, mat-board grouping, and full type customization.
          </p>
          <p>
            Built with react. Atypical design paradigms were necessary for the
            skewmorphic effect during the 'drag' operation. Resultant
            architecture is difficult to maintain and extend. Refactorization
            using Hooks and Context may be possible and will be attempted before
            futher development, but full display update during the drag
            operation must be present to fulfill project requirements.

            This project was built for a Colorado-based local business. The
            business' main advertising medium is face to face contact and
            referrals, which needed to be backed up with a website easily served
            up on a customer's phone. The client requested that all materials be
            presented on a single page. Delivering all the information and
            functionality one page proved to be a challenge more than I
            expected, and the project quickly grew out of my initially staged
            plans for development.
          </p>
          <p>
            The site runs on a node and express server. The site is a single
            page presentation. It is a landing page, about page, product page
            and order form at once. It uses a simple parallax on desktop and
            image background to provide a solid color at the top for legibility
            and cleanliness, and a Colorado-esque scene at the bottom for
            customer familiarity and business branding.

            This is a desktop application used to query from multiple databases
            using the same user interface. The application is highly extensible,
            using dependency injection, software interfaces, and object-oriented
            paradigms. It is still in development, will be adding MySQL Shell
            and Mongo Atlas connections.
          </p>
          <p>
            The primary functional requirement of this application is the
            ability to make queries upon multiple databases from the same
            window. The requirements do not encompass extensive creation of
            records, however full SQL statements can be interpreted. The
            project's main limitation is the chosen UI tech. Current
            implementation of table display for data in tKinter is too
            difficult, UI tech and layer needs to be changed. Usage of layered
            architecture and software interfaces will help in the conversion to
            a more robust UI.

            This project was built for a local business-woman sole-proprietor.
            Her business model has been restricted to Instagram, limiting her
            ability to provide her clientele and community access to her
            services. The LumberJack template allows her to showcase her
            expertise and have a blog generating affiliate links and providing
            additional learning and enrichment opportunities to her clients. I
            worked with the owner, matching her business mission statement with
            a brand sense that appeals to her audience.

            Showcasing the client's primary business traffic encourages
            link-through SEO and grants audience ease-of-access to other

            This project is the conclusion to a hypothesis I had while a music
            teacher. At that time I did not know anything about programming
            other than it must follow standard logic principles. In short, I
            theorized that if you put all the 'rules' of music theory into code
            and allowed for randomization in it's choices, the resultant music
            would be surprisingly familiar and even sound pretty good at times-
            with only occasional awkward moments. JavaScript and the WebAudio
            API are used to provide a web-based ear-trainer and infinite music
            generator.
          </p>

          <p>
            This project is two-fold, containing a set of practice tools, as
            well as a music generator. The tools help a student train their ear
            in the subjects of melody, relative pitch, pitch memory, and tempo.
            The music generator is a passion project that I will continue to
            build upon for some time. My more recent study in object-oriented
            principles leads me to realize the entirety of the project needs
            redesign and overhaul to move very far forward. However, the
            underlying logic in how to sort through the musical information has
            been solved. In time it will not only be an expression of the power
            of western musical structures, but also a learning device.
          </p>
          <p>
            The application has a high level of educational value for a student
            or professional. Certain skills that were difficult to practice have
            been made available and accentuated through the use of the trainers.
            Work your klangfarbenmelodie chops with multiple orchestral
            instrument choices. The music trainer includes a function which
            allows for different instruments to randomly substitute the primary
            instrument sound, while still asking the student to repeat the
            pattern back. This develops the ear to be sensitive to pitch while
            listening to instruments outside of their familiarity. The melodic
            idea consisting of the same note, but different tones/instruments,
            is called "klangfarbenmelodie". This melody trainer facilitates the
            study of an invaluable skill that is difficult to methodically
            practice.

            "LumberJack" is a full-stack template developed for small businesses
            and social media creators. The theme is lightweight and integrates
            third-party services to eliminate update, security, and code-heavy
            issues. Featuring a headless CMS with Prismic, a multi-network
            aggregator in Curator, and automatic email responses by NodeMailer,
            LumberJack's needs for maintenance and updates are low. Ships with
            detailed setup instructions accessible by any front-end developer or
            diligent person.
          </p>
          <p>
            Making use of third-party API's keeps the website owner from having
            to engage with the site code after launch, keeping breakage to a
            minimum. LumberJack's blog is automatically generated using EJS and
            comes with a "Custom Type" ready to upload to your Prismic
            repository. Curator allows owners and creators to build feeds from
            more than one network, enabling more cross-network audience
            engagement.
          </p>
          <p>
            Designed for a two-color brand scheme with highly legible greyscale
            copy. Card elements are modular and can be used in a variety of
            configurations, color and size. LumberJack is fully compatible with
            any device.

              My music instruction business was conducted via online video chat.
              It allowed me to reach a wide range of people. Relationships can
              be built and effective work performed in a remote setting, I'm
              looking forward to continuing to do so.

              I excelled as a musician and educator. Order and cleanliness give
              way to beautiful and functional ideas. Learning has been my

              as many directions as it takes to get it perfect. Coding seems

              Every challenge in music or with a student is different. However
              you overcome it, the solution must always function correctly. But
              the solutions are frequently unique. This appeals to me, writing
              and designing code feels much the same, with the added bonus of
              showing your work to the world!

          Elephant Chart is an organization application. It features a
          skewmorphic (life-like) drag and drop, and saveable custom charts
          and layouts. It uses Firebase for authorization and storage of chart data.
          Users can log in via Google or any standard email address. The application 
          makes use of moveable visual containers that can be grouped and layered 
          to create a tool helpful where organization of ideas or information is 
          necesary. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Elephant Charts can be extremely large, and each note has a tray where 
          the user can store additional information. A 'Mat' function allows the user 
          to group and move notes or other mats together. With the large size, and 
          three or more levels of visual information organization, Elephant Chart 
          lives up to it's name. Backboard and note colors can be set by user and 
          individual notes can be checked off. Future versions will include a 'Share' 
          function, multi-select, additional shapes and note backgrounds, arrows and 
          flow chart graphics, strings and tack graphics, full type customization, and 
          more. Maybe even trash can basketball! It's supposed to imitate real life, 
          after all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Built with React. Experimentation with Hooks and Context is needed
          before much further development. Potential full refactor if skewmorphic 
          effect can be maintained in more efficient architecture.

          This project was built for a Colorado-based local business,
          unfortunately affected by the recent fires. The business' main
          advertising medium is face to face contact and referrals, which
          needed to be backed up with a website quickly delivered on a 
          potential customer's phone. The client requested that all materials be
          presented on a single page. Delivering all the information and
          functionality on one page was an interesting challenge.
        </p>
        <p>
          The site runs on a node and express server. The site is a single
          page presentation. It's a Landing page, About page, Product page,
          and Order page in one. It uses a single parallax on desktop and
          custom image background to provide a solid color at the top for legibility
          and cleanliness, gradually moving to a Colorado mountain scene for
          customer familiarity and business branding. Fully custom CSS and JS 
          animation and form work.

          This is a desktop application used to query from multiple databases
          using the same user interface. The application is highly extensible,
          using dependency injection, software interfaces, and object-oriented
          paradigms. It is still in development, will be adding MySQL Shell
          and Mongo Atlas connections. The project is on 'hold' until an 
          appropriate UI tech is implemented.
        </p>
        <p>
          The primary functional requirement of this application is to query 
          different database providers from the same application window. The 
          requirements do not encompass extensive creation of records at this time, 
          however full SQL statements can be interpreted. The project's primary 
          limitation is the chosen user interface tech. Displaying table data in 
          tKinter is highly impractical. A completely new UI technology and layer 
          needs to be chosen and created. Layered architecture and software 
          interfaces will allow for an easy transition to a more robust UI.

          This project was built for a sole-proprietorship dog trainer. The business
          model has been restricted to Instagram, limiting the ability to provide 
          clientele and the community access to the business. The LumberJack template 
          showcases her services, message, and contact info, while the blog can 
          generate affiliate links and provide additional learning and enrichment 
          opportunities to her clients.'Friendly' design elements match her business 
          mission statement and generates a brand sense that appeals to her target 
          demographics.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the clients current model is proving successful, directly embedding that 
          content as a media carousel was efficient for me as a developer and increases 
          the value of every Instagram post she makes. With her primary business traffic 
          directly on the site, link-through SEO is increased and grants her audience 
          ease-of-access to other materials and monetizable content. Mobile-friendly 
          content creation allows the business owner to produce content more efficiently 
          and from any place she has service.

          JavaScript ES6 and the WebAudio API are used to provide a web-based
          ear-trainer and infinite music generator. The tools help a student 
          train their musical ear in the subjects of melody, relative pitch, 
          pitch memory, and tempo. The music generator is a passion project 
          and experiment that I will return to. My more recent study in 
          object-oriented principles and software architecture has led me to 
          realize the entirety of the project needs refactor and rearchitecture! 
          However, the underlying logic in how to solve the 'musical problems' 
          works well, and supports my hypothesis.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Music Generator is the conclusion to a hypothesis I formed while 
          teaching music. My theory was that if you programmed all the 'rules' 
          of music theory and then allowed for randomization in it's choices, 
          the results would be surprisingly familiar and even sound pretty good 
          at times- with only occasional awkward moments! The goal of the project,
          given further development, is that the generator will express the power 
          of western musical structures (usually termed 'music theory') by allowing 
          them to 'speak' without human interaction, showcasing their merit and the 
          'natural behavior' of music.
        </p>

        <p>
          The application has a high level of educational value for any musician. 
          The Melodic Trainer facilitates musical development through use of an 
          invaluable skill that is difficult to methodically practice. The melodic 
          idea consisting of the same note, but different tones/instruments, is 
          called "klangfarbenmelodie". The trainer utilizes and teaches this with a 
          mode randomizing the playback to multiple orchestral instrument choices. 
          This develops the ear to be sensitive to pitch while listening to instruments 
          outside of the students familiarity, accentuating the 'pitch' side of the learning.

          "LumberJack" is a full-stack template developed for small businesses
          and social media creators. The theme integrates third-party services 
          to eliminate update, security, and issues associated with code-heavy 
          CMS templates. Featuring a headless CMS with Prismic, a multi-network
          aggregator in Curator, and automatic email responses by NodeMailer,
          LumberJack's needs for maintenance and updates are low. Ships with
          detailed setup instructions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Making use of third-party API's keeps the website operator from having
          to engage with the site code after launch, keeping user-breakage to a
          minimum. LumberJack's blog is generated using EJS and Prismic. 
          Curator allows owners and creators to build feeds from more than one 
          network, enabling more cross-network audience engagement.

            I started studying layout while operating an offset printing press in 
            high-school. My first computer was the latest and greatest 6x86 Pentium 
            chip of 1996! I have always been drawn to layout and technology, 
            and the elegance in how information can be displayed or delivered.

            Operating a music instruction business for 12 years, which was partially 
            conducted online, I learned how to work effectively in a remote setting where 
            a very high level of interaction was required. I am excellent at managing my 
            workflow and self-directing both creative and logical tasks.

            Being an educator requires the ability to approach a challenge from as many 
            directions as it takes to get the job done. The same goes for music. 
            Sometimes it's a delicate task, occasionally it takes heavy lifting.
            I am experienced with problem solving from many angles.

            In teaching and music, clearly delivering information is the key 
            to effective communication. This seems to apply everywhere! From 
            a symphony to comments put into the code, delivering a printed message 
            to structuring an object, the less extraneous fluff the better.

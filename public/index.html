                <p>The NOAA Great Lakes Level Viewer is a tool that's part of the inundation series of app's hosted by The Office for Coastal Management.
                    I led the development team on this project while mentoring a junior developer. We interfaced with the Physical Scientists involved in 
                    the management of the data to ensure maximum integrity and accuracy of the simulations. The app was showcased to the US Congress and
                    other government bodies with great reception.

                    <li>
                        Provided a Social Vulnerability layer for users via CDC API, and a Depth Query feature to query multiple points of water levles in the inundation zone or the shoreline.

                Under direction from Federal Product Owners, built a tool that
                allows the user to inundate the shores of all the US Great Lakes.
                The tool is made public for city planners, residents, and civil
                engineers to make decisions based on the provided simulated data.
                A link sharing method using base-64 strings appended to the URL
                allow users to share the exact location and water-level. A hash params URL
                system also allows external organizations to utilize the tool dynamically,
                by allowing coordinate, water-level, and unit of measure to be controlled
                via URL parameters.  
              </p>
              <p>
                Using OpenLayers and a pixel-rendering system, various water-levels
                are displayed in reference to a Depth Elevation Map surrounding the
                shores of the Great Lakes. Multiple basemap types are available to
                the user, as well as an Social Vulnerability layer provided by the
                CDC via API.

                A custom layout and build for a client running specialty-food
                delivery business, primarily conducted and advertised on mobile.
                The client requested that all materials be presented the same,
                while on a single page, with no loss of content on mobile. I
                worked in tandem with a UX writer to achieve the client's
                requests and generate site language and microcopy. The project's
                primary challenge was in it's layout and copy needs rather than
                it's technical build.

                'life-like' drag and drop, and saveable custom charts and

                This project is being developing with another engineer. The
                software is built on a node server, which chains various modules
                together resulting in a potential <i>Options Contract</i> being
                purchased, and followup <i>Stop Limit Order</i> being placed.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are 10 distinct modules, a simple chart interface, and a
                database that a generated data packet moves through or is
                operated upon.
              </p>
              <p>
                Small coupler modules sit between the server and module. This
                decouples the server and module allowing for controlled
                development and potential middleware in the future.
              </p>
              <p>
                An Interface Pattern is under development to allow for multiple
                Investor API Clients to be connected and run simultaneously from
                the same algorithm.

                A logger module continously sends updates to an alert manager

                      The Melodic Trainer serves as a valuable tool for musical development, targeting a skill that is often challenging to systematically practice. Centered around the concept of "klangfarbenmelodie", where a single note is expressed through different tones and instruments, this trainer fosters sensitivity to pitch by randomizing playback across multiple orchestral instrument choices. This approach expands the student's auditory palette beyond familiar instruments, enriching their musical understanding.

                logic in how to solve the musical problems works well.
              </p>
              <p>
                The goal of the project, given further development, is that the
                generator will express the power of musical structures (usually
                termed 'music theory') by allowing them to 'speak' without human
                interaction.

                The Melodic Trainer facilitates musical development through use
                of an invaluable skill that is difficult to methodically
                practice. The melodic idea consisting of the same note, but
                different tones/instruments, is called "klangfarbenmelodie". The
                trainer utilizes and teaches this with a mode randomizing the
                playback to multiple orchestral instrument choices. This
                develops the ear to be sensitive to pitch while listening to
                instruments outside of the student's familiarity.

                A rainy-day project to capture the motion of the planets of the
                solar system. I've loved space and the stars since I was a young
                kid. This project is a way that I can do some 'exploring' of
                space on my own. Next task is to work up a more convincing Moon
                Component, and add the appropriate moons to each planet. There
                are almost 200 moons in our solar system.
              </p>
              <p>
                The imaging effect is a combination of CSS and React.
                Positioning is found from a normally-positioned object, whose
                coordinates are then cast onto a separate plane that is rotated
                down to a horizontal 'orbit'. Combined it forms a 3D illusion,
                and not a true 3D space.
              </p>
              <p>
                The background is an image from the new James Web Telescope. The
                planets and sun all exist on scale with each other in size and
                orbital angle. However, to make it visible on the screen certain
                bodies needed to be further scaled down in size. The four inner
                planets and as well as Pluto are correctly related in size to
                each other, the four large gas giants are in reality 20 times
                larger than they appear in this simulation, and the sun is 200
                times larger than in the simulation.

                  years, partially taught online, I have experience in a remote

                  Preparing music requires you to approach each challenge from
                  as many directions as it takes, and in performance you always
                  need a backup plan. Music requires you to utilize established
                  principles - while also thinking on your feet<br />and being
                  creative.
